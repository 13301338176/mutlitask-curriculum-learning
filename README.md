# CS 381V Fall 2017 Course Project
## Multi Task Curriculum Learning for Computer Vision
We explored jointly using the paradigms of Multi Task Learning and Curriculum Learning for the tasks of 3D representation learning, image restoration and image classification. This was our final project of [Visual Recognition](http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/381V-fall2017/) course offered by [Prof. Kristen Grauman](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/) in Fall 2017. Our final project report can be found [here](https://github.com/srama2512/cs381v-project/blob/master/report.pdf).
